A simple package to efficiently calculate ideal gas properties based on NASA polynomials. This assumes that the specifc heat
of the gas/mixture is only a function of its temperature, i.e., $c_p(T)$ , $h(T)$, and $s(T,p)$ (note the entropy is a function of both pressure and temperature).

This package is primarily intended for use in gas turbine cycle calculations with a focus on computational efficiency (and gradient calculations for downstream calculations). As such, there are a number of functions here that are relevant for thermodynamic cycle analysis (e.g., compressing a gas at a given polytropic efficiency, setting a flow Mach number, mixing, and ideal combustion etc). 

This package also introduces a method for fast calculations of thermodynamic properties of mixtures with fixed composition by calculating an equivalent polynomial representation of the mixture. See docs for theory and performance details.
